# Advent of Code 2020

Advent of code is a yearly competition with 25 two-part coding challenge. This repository stores my solutions to the problems. Interesting problems include a 4-D Conway Game of Life and a [math expression solver](https://github.com/staadecker/math-solver).

Disclaimer: most of the code is an absolute mess since I wrote the solutions in one session and never plan to look at the code again.

You can find the Advent of Code website [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
